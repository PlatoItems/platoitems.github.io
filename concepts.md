## Public Gifting @Fear

We currently don't have the option of gifting items to players in public rooms or groups. It's a feature that would make those spaces even more interactive and fun. 

In this concept, we are able to select and gift anyone from the list of online participants. Public gifts are announced in the chat for all to see, but we need to ensure that the gift messages are not too intrusive.

Why would anyone choose to publicly gift players? It's a show of appreciation and, for some, a flex. ðŸ¤‘

## Ghost @Fear

The "Ghost" can be purchased as an item, such as a badge. Once equipped, users will no longer see you in the online list of public rooms or groups. This protects player privacy by preventing others from sending friend requests, and helps avoid unwanted interactions in public chat. We need to ensure that the item is costly, as we don't want our entire community to be ghosted.

Note: Even if some players are ghosted, the online list will still show the actual number of online players.

## Private Groups

**Inactive Members @Rose**

It's difficult to keep track of inactive group members, and group admins often kick players at random to free up space. It would be helpful if there was a separate list which displayed members who had the least amount of activity (time spent online in the group). This should help large groups in replacing inactive members with new active members, resulting in a more active group.

**Direct Kick @Fear**

When there are too many participants in a private group, it can be tedious to find a specific player from the list. An option to directly remove players from within the chat would be extremely useful.

**Increase Group Members @abc**

Currently, groups can have a maximum of 500 members. This isn't practical for very active groups, and active members must be removed to make room for new members. The maximum number of members should be preliminarily increased to 1000. To limit lag, the maximum number of members online at any one time should remain at 500.

**Silent Mode @Fear**

Groups tend to become crowded with online players during tournaments or important events, making it difficult for hosts to effectively share important announcements while the group chat is flooded with messages. It would be very useful for group admins to be able to mute or block messages from group members indefinitely.

**Verified Group @Fear**

A special badge for influential groups or communities selected by server leaders. This concept would give much-deserved recognition to active and contributing groups. A verified group would appear at the top of the "Groups" list for all of its participants.

## Privacy

**Account Password @Fear**

This concept can help players secure their accounts and safely change their registered email without compromising account security.

Players who have registered their accounts will see a new "Account Password" option in Settings. It would allow them to create a password for their accounts, which they can later use to change their registered email.

In case of a forgotten password, they can reset it using a one-time code sent to their registered email. If they do not have access to the registered email, they will be unable to reset the password.

**Hyperlink Redirect Notice @abc**

A URL within a message is automatically converted to a clickable hyperlink that links directly to the website. There are risks associated with clicking unknown links, including tracking, phishing, malware etc. Whether they click intentionally or accidentally, it would be safer to provide an intermediate redirect notice, perhaps outlining the risks.

## Premium Packs @Fear

Premium packs contain *very rare* items and can only be obtained through in-app purchases.

- Items inside a premium pack cannot be gifted or purchased with coins.
- New premium packs are added to the shop every month, old ones are occasionally and temporarily re-added to the shop.

## Gift Tokens @Fear

Gift tokens can be purchased or gifted from the shop. Each costing only 250 coins, it's not just an item, but a token that you and your friends can collect and later use to claim exclusive packs.

- New exclusive packs containing *very rare* items are added to the shop every month.
- Exclusive packs can only be purchased from the shop with gift tokens.
- Prices of exclusive packs may vary from 50 to 250 gift tokens, depending on the rarity of items they contain.

## Badge Stickers @Fear

A badge is only used as cosmetic for your profile. There's little value to it, unless equipped badges could also be sent as stickers in the chat.

Plato Team: Roger that. Increasing prices of all badges. They are no longer just badges!

## Badge Slots @abc

Currently, there are up to 7 slots available next to a player's username for badges, 5 for gold stars, 1 for a chat badge, and 1 for a standard badge.

Players are restricted in how they can use these slots. Each gold star they own takes up a slot and cannot be removed. A chat badge is automatically applied when they use a chat bubble. They only have full control over the 1 standard badge slot.

In this concept, every player initially has 2 badge slots. Up to 5 more additional badge slots can be purchased for 10,000 coins each. They can add, remove and reorder badges in these slots.

As part of the migration, gold stars and chat badges become standard badges. Players who currently own gold stars will initially have that number of additional badge slots i.e. 4 gold stars = 6 badge slots.

This will let players have more control over how their profile looks, allowing them to be more creative and unique. They will be able to make use of duplicate badges they currently own. It gives them an incentive to purchase duplicate badges (7 red pixels) or sets of badges (all cats).
