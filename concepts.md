## Public Gifting @Fear

We currently don't have the option of gifting items to players in public rooms or groups. It's a feature that would make those spaces even more interactive and fun. 

In this concept, we are able to select and gift anyone from the list of online participants. Public gifts are announced in the chat for all to see, but we need to ensure that the gift messages are displayed in a less intrusive way.

Why would anyone choose to publicly gift players? It's a show of appreciation and, for some, a flex. ðŸ¤‘

## Ghost @Fear

The "Ghost" can be purchased as an item, such as a badge. Once equipped, users will no longer see you in the online list of public rooms or groups. This protects player privacy by preventing others from sending friend requests, and helps avoid unwanted interactions in public chat. We need to ensure that the item is costly, as we don't want our entire community to be ghosted.

Note: Even if some players are ghosted, the online list will still show the actual number of online players.

## Premium Packs @Fear

Premium packs contain *very rare* items and can only be obtained through in-app purchases.

- Items inside a premium pack cannot be gifted or purchased with coins.
- New premium packs are added to the shop every month, old ones are occasionally and temporarily re-added to the shop.

## Gift Tokens @Fear

Gift tokens can be purchased or gifted from the shop. Each costing only 100 coins, it's not just an item, but a token that you and your friends can collect and later use to claim exclusive packs.

- New exclusive packs containing *very rare* items are added to the shop every month.
- Exclusive packs can only be purchased from the shop with gift tokens.
- Prices of exclusive packs may vary from 50 to 250 gift tokens, depending on the rarity of items they contain.

## Badge Stickers @Fear

A badge is only used as cosmetic for your profile. There's little value to it, unless equipped badges could also be sent as stickers in the chat.

Plato Team: Roger that. Increasing prices of all badges. They are no longer just badges!

## Badge Slots @abc

Currently, there are up to 7 slots available next to a player's username for badges, 5 for gold stars, 1 for a chat badge, and 1 for a standard badge.

Players are restricted in how they can use these slots. Each gold star they own takes up a slot and cannot be removed. A chat badge is automatically applied when they use a chat bubble. They only have full control over the 1 standard badge slot.

In this concept, every player initially has 2 badge slots. Up to 5 more additional badge slots can be purchased for 10,000 coins each. They can add, remove and reorder badges in these slots.

As part of the migration, gold stars and chat badges become standard badges. Players who currently own gold stars will initially have that number of additional badge slots i.e. 4 gold stars = 6 badge slots.

This will let players have more control over how their profile looks, allowing them to be more creative and unique. They will be able to make use of duplicate badges they currently own. It gives them an incentive to purchase duplicate badges (7 red pixels) or sets of badges (all cats).
